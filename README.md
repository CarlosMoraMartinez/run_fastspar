This script calls FastSpar to generate correlations between ASVs/OTUs/taxa (https://github.com/scwatts/fastspar)

Accepts an abundance table and a metadata file, and splits the abundance table according to specified fields in the metadata. Then, uses FastSpar to compute correlations and p-values for each sample group.
